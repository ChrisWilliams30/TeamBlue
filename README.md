First project for MacEwan Universities introduction to AI course, CMPT 355 Fall 2016. 

You are given:  
 - a set of n^2 + 1 large disks stamped with 1, 2 , 3 , or 4.  
 - a set of n^2 smaller disks, of which n are stamped with 1, n are stamped with 2, n are stamped with 3, and
finally n are stamped with n.

You have won the game when all of the same small disks stamped with 1 are next to each other, followed by all
small disks stamp with 2, and so on, and finally followed by an uncovered large disk. Remember they are placed
in a circle.
